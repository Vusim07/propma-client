# Project Plan: AI Email Handler for Amara using AWS SES & Supabase Edge Functions

## Overview

The goal of this implementation is to create a scalable, automated email handling system for **Amara** (agentamara.com) that enables:

- Programmatic generation of unique email addresses per team/user (e.g., `firstname-fc780ach08s08@n.agentamara.com`)
- Receiving and analyzing inbound emails sent to these addresses
- Sending AI-generated responses
- Viewing a log of all email correspondence in an "Inbox" UI
- Monitoring errors and bounces to maintain reliability

This system leverages **AWS SES** for email delivery and receipt, **Supabase Edge Functions** for processing, and a **Vite + React** frontend for UI.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vite + React
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions (TypeScript)
- **Email Service**: AWS SES (Amazon Simple Email Service)
- **Auth & Data**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- **DNS**: Cloudflare

## New Features Implemented

1. **Unified Email Address System**

   - Support for both individual and team email addresses
   - Automatic email address generation via database trigger
   - Primary email address designation

2. **Enhanced Email Threading**

   - Thread-based conversation organization
   - Support for message threading and replies
   - Priority and follow-up tracking

3. **AI Integration**

   - AI suggestion system for responses
   - Confidence scoring for suggestions
   - Support for different suggestion types (follow-up, response, classification)

4. **Advanced Email Management**
   - Comprehensive status tracking
   - Attachment handling
   - Delivery logging
   - Support for both plain text and HTML content

---

## Notes

- **Subdomain Usage**: All user-generated email addresses are under `n.agentamara.com`
- **Fallback Routing**: Unmatched SES receipts go to a default handler
- **AI Response Timing**: Ensure latency between receipt and response is acceptable (use async queue if needed)
- **Team Support**: System now supports both individual agents and teams with shared email addresses
- **Data Security**: RLS policies ensure proper access control for all email data

---

## Final Goal

Users should be able to:

1. Use their unique Amara email (e.g., `team-alpha@n.agentamara.com`) on contact forms
2. Have inbound messages parsed, responded to, and logged automatically
3. View all correspondence in an intuitive UI
4. Leverage AI suggestions for efficient communication
5. Manage both individual and team email communications

This will streamline tenant communications and centralize audit trails for Amara clients.
