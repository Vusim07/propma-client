Designing a CrewAI Agent for Rent Affordability Assessment

1. Agent Design Patterns & Structured Data Handling
   For a finance-oriented agent, a single-agent system (a coherent workflow of LLM calls and tool calls) is often ideal: it orchestrates multiple steps (income parsing, expense summarization, rule checks) in sequence and loops until a conclusion is reached
   learn.microsoft.com
   . The agent should treat the structured JSON (bank transactions, payslips, credit report) as input and use specialized tools (e.g. a Python/math tool) to compute sums and metrics. One can encode this as a deterministic chain or “chain of thought” with explicit steps: parse income, sum debts, apply rule, etc. This fixed pipeline ensures auditability and is easy to debug. For example, CrewAI can use a PythonREPL tool or custom functions to accurately calculate net income and debt totals, then pass results back to the LLM for final reasoning. In more complex deployments, a multi-agent architecture with a “critic” or verifier agent may be used: recent research found that adding a reflective critic agent in financial QA tasks improved accuracy by ~15%

   . However, for a single-domain affordability check the simpler single-agent (or few-step chain) design is likely sufficient.
2. Hybrid Logic and LLM Reasoning
   Pure LLM reasoning can be unpredictable for strict financial rules, so it’s best to combine deterministic logic with LLM generation. Key techniques include:
   Explicit rule invocation: Instruct the LLM to apply the 30% rule (e.g. “ensure rent ≤ 30% of net income”) and to output all calculations. This structured prompt (with exact conditions) reduces chance of oversight

   .
   External computation (Program-of-Thought): Use a tool to perform arithmetic. For example, have the agent call a Python or calculator tool to compute monthly income, debt, and 30% threshold; then feed those results into the LLM for interpretation. This “disentangles computation from reasoning” for higher accuracy
   arxiv.org
   .
   Hybrid rule engine: Let the LLM propose a decision, but enforce the final check with code. In other words, the LLM can reason “in natural language,” but a rule-based check (if rent ≤ 0.3×income) makes the final yes/no decision
   medium.com
   . This hybrid ensures deterministic compliance: the agent’s output can still explain its reasoning, yet cannot override the hard rule.
   Structured output with low temperature: Always request answers in a fixed format (JSON or bullet list) and use a temperature=0 or 0.2 to minimize random variation
   medium.com
   . Constraining the LLM in this way (“format: {‘affordable’: true/false, ‘reasoning’: …}”) helps enforce logic and avoid hallucinations.
3. Observability, Testing and Metrics
   Production agents require robust monitoring and evaluation. Tools like AgentOps (or Langfuse, Arize, etc.) can capture detailed logs: session replays, token usage, latency and cost tracking, infinite-loop detection, and more
   docs.crewai.com
   . For example, AgentOps provides dashboards showing LLM calls and tool calls sequence, and even “time-travel” debugging to replay a session step-by-step
   docs.crewai.com
   docs.crewai.com
   . To evaluate performance, define clear metrics: e.g. percentage of correctly classified “affordable” cases, false positives/negatives, and average confidence. Create domain-specific test cases (known bank/payslip scenarios) and run custom tests regularly
   docs.crewai.com
   . Track changes over time to detect drift (e.g. if new income patterns emerge). Logging should include both the LLM’s outputs and the actual computed values (income, expenses, ratio) for auditing. For compliance, enable audit logs (to catch PII leaks or prompt injections) and review error cases manually. In short, use the built‑in telemetry (AgentOps etc.) plus unit tests of the affordability logic to ensure the agent remains accurate and reliable

   .
4. Output Validation & Auditability
   To minimize hallucinations and allow audits, the agent’s report should show its work and cite any authoritative rules. Best practices:
   Embed numeric calculations: Have the agent include interim values (e.g. “Net monthly income = $X. 30% of this = $Y. Target rent = $Z”) so a reviewer can easily verify the math.
   Reference source rules: If applicable, cite financial guidelines. For example, “By the common ‘30% rule’, housing costs shouldn’t exceed 30% of income
   bankatfirst.com
   ,” then show that our numbers obey or violate this. Including the source of the rule (e.g. a financial blog or regulation) adds trust.
   Structured/JSON output: Use Azure’s JSON mode/structured output to enforce a strict schema
   learn.microsoft.com
   . For instance, demand output like {"can_afford": true, "net_income": X, "max_rent": Y, "target_rent": Z, "explanation": "..."}; this prevents free-form text that could hide errors.
   Temperature and verification chain: Keep sampling low (near 0) and consider using a “chain-of-thought” or multi-step answer so all reasoning is in the output. Optionally, run the output through a verifier agent or a second model to check consistency.
   Human-in-the-loop checks: For edge cases, flag outputs for manual review. The final answer should clearly justify Yes/No with numbers, ensuring auditors can trace every decision step

5. JSON Input Formatting Tips
   When feeding the structured OCR data to Azure OpenAI, make it as clear and concise as possible. Recommendations:
   Use concise keys and units: Rename fields to be unambiguous (e.g. "monthly_salary": 5000 not "salary": 5000"), and keep units consistent (all dollars, all months).
   Trim unnecessary data: Only include fields needed for the decision. For instance, list aggregated values (total monthly income, total monthly debt payments, etc.) instead of dozens of individual transactions, if possible.
   Chunk or summarize long lists: If transactions or payslip line-items are many, provide only the sums or a short representative sample. Large JSON can exceed token limits.
   Include context in prompt: In the system or user instruction, explicitly describe the JSON format (e.g. “The input JSON has keys: bank_transactions (list of {date, amount}), payslip (total_income, tax_deductions), credit (current_debt, etc.), and target_rent.”). This helps the model parse the fields correctly.
   Consider function calling: Azure’s function-calling can parse JSON fields directly; you can define a function like calculate_affordability(data: JSON) -> JSON to let the model return structured results. This reduces prompt ambiguity.
   Encapsulate JSON in code blocks: Present the JSON input inside triple backticks in the prompt so it’s clearly delineated. Always validate that the JSON is valid.
   By keeping the input structured and minimal, the LLM can focus on reasoning rather than parsing noise.

This architecture uses preprocessing tools (e.g. Python/REPL) to compute key values from the JSON, then applies the affordability rule. The decision node (E) flags whether the rent passes the rule. Finally, the LLM produces a human-readable explanation and structured report (F → G). Throughout, observability components capture metrics and logs for auditing. Sources: Agent design principles
